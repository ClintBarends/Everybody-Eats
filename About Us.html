      <p class="jamie">We have Jamie, who is an avid lover of all types of food. He recently went through some struggles with his health where he was always fatigued, had regular digestive and flu-like symptoms and was constantly feeling dreadful. So after many visits to the doctor and a few months of trial and error with adjusting his diet, it was discovered that he was gluten intolerant. Not wanting to let this kill his love for food, he has now been on a mission to find the best gluten-free meals that he can find. He has been in great health since his change in diet and is a firm believer of the danger gluten can cause to those who are intolerant, not just with the immediate effects it has but also the long term damage it can cause. So he is on the team with a heart to find great gluten-free meals when eating out if and to help all those in the position he was in a year ago to not give up and realize that this doesn't have to change your love for food. So if you struggle with finding great gluten-free foods, keep your eyes glued to the channel for great ideas and alternatives for the gluten-intolerant individual.</p>
